Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// Added missing closing brackets at the end of the file
    )}
  )}
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the `return` statement
2. Missing closing bracket for the `InspectionForm` component

I've added both closing brackets while maintaining all the existing code structure and functionality. The code should now be syntactically complete and valid.
